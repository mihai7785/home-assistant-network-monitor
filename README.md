# home-assistant-network-monitor

Home Assistant AI-Powered Network Monitor
AI powered network monitor system for home use


📌 Project Overview

This project provides an AI-powered network monitoring system for Home Assistant, allowing users to track connected devices, detect anomalies, and receive smart alerts when unusual network activity occurs.

✅ Features

Real-time network scanning: Detects all connected devices on the local network.

InfluxDB integration: Stores device history in InfluxDB for analysis.

Home Assistant alerts: Sends notifications for new or missing devices.

AI-powered anomaly detection: Uses LLaMA via Ollama to identify unusual activity.

Grafana dashboard: Provides historical insights and network trends.

AI-generated reports: Summarizes network activity trends and alerts users.
